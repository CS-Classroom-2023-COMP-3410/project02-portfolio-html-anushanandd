I started by organizing my ideas and the content for the website on a Google Doc. I gave the information from the Doc to ChatGPT to create the basic website. Then, I started prompting ChatGPT with changes to the font and layout where I had to frequently remind it to not use any css. There were some small tweaks, like having the navigation bar not stretch across the width of the page, I would have to figure out by myself as the ChatGPT suggestions did not work, but everything else was fairly straightforward. I also had issues accessing the Linux servers when off-campus, but I resolved this by connecting to the DU WiFi while on-campus. I also was not able to committ on Github through VSCode, so I had to manually add every file on the Github website.
